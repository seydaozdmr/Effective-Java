         * The basic idea behind Javaâ€™s enum types is simple: they are classes that export
         * one instance for each enumeration constant via a public static final field. Enum
         * types are effectively final, by virtue of having no accessible constructors. Because
         * clients can neither create instances of an enum type nor extend it, there can be no
         * instances but the declared enum constants. In other words, enum types are
         * instance-controlled (page 6). They are a generalization of singletons (Item 3),
         * which are essentially single-element enums.

         * Comparable (Item 14) and Serializable (Chapter 12), and their serialized
         * form is designed to withstand most changes to the enum type.
